1. Basic information
Team number (e.g., 01) : 
#1 Student ID : 
#1 Student Name : 
#2 Student ID : 
#2 Student Name : 
OS (bit) : Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit)
gcc version : 5.4.0


2. Meta-data
- Show your meta-data design (Tables and Columns table) and information about each column.


3. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that your team hasn't implemented this feature.
- Describe how you store a VarChar field.
- Describe how you deal with an update and delete.

Update operation:
When the updated record cannot fit into the original page, we move it to another page with enough free space, and leave a
tombstone (pointer) in the original page. The pointer consists of two parts. The first part uses 4 bytes to store the actual
page number, and the second part uses 2 bytes to store the slot number in the actual page. Also, in this case the record offset
in the slot directory of the original page becomes the offset of the pointer. In order to distinguish this special case
from the ordinary one, we set the offset to PAGE_SIZE + (offset of pointer).


4. Page Format
- Show your page format design.
- Describe how you deal with an update and delete.

Slot directory design:
1) If record length == 0, this record has been deleted.
2) If record offset >= PAGE_SIZE, this record has been moved to another page (due to the update operation).

Delete operation:
1) Set record length to 0 to indicate that this record is deleted.
2) If record offset < PAGE_SIZE, shift left to remove this record, so that we always keep the free space in the middle part of this page.
3) If record offset >= PAGE_SIZE, find the actual page containing this record, and shift left to remove this record.
   Also, shift left to remove the tombstone (pointer) of this record in the original page.
4) Update the free space in the slot directory of related pages (original and and actual page)
