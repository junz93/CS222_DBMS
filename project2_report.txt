- Describe how you deal with an update and delete.

Slot directory design:
1) If record length == 0, this record has been deleted.
2) If record offset >= PAGE_SIZE, this record has been moved to another page (due to the update operation).

Delete operation:
1) Set record length to 0 to indicate that this record is deleted.
2) If record offset < PAGE_SIZE, shift left to remove this record, so that we always keep the free space in the middle part of this page.
3) If record offset >= PAGE_SIZE, find the actual page containing this record, and shift left to remove this record.
   Also, shift left to remove the tombstone (pointer) of this record in the original page.
4) Update the free space in the slot directory of related pages (original and and actual page)
